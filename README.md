# First_Project

this project uses a collection of languages and therefore requires a couple of different commands in order to run.

the first command is using SQLite, this will produce the database from which all info is pulled.
sqlite3 db/guitar_shop.db < db/guitar_shop.sql

the second command is using python, this will run through a list of functions within the console.py document
python3 console.py
